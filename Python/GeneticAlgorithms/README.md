Description: Chartists are financial experts who look for recurring shape patterns in stock prices
and then use those patterns to predict future stock movements. For this project you will be creating
a genetic algorithm to detect 2-day chart patterns in financial data.
Training File Data: You will be provided with two files of data: genAlgData1.txt and
genAlgData2.txt. The files each contain training data based on 30 years of price data for the S&P
500. For debugging purposes you are required to create small hand-designed data files to test for
correctness â€“ you will turn in the testing file(s) as part of your submission.
